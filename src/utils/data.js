To practice active listening: Give Full Attention: When a teenager wants to talk, put aside distractions. Show you’re genuinely interested by maintaining eye contact and responding thoughtfully. Validate Their Feelings: Even if you don’t fully understand their experiences, acknowledge their emotions. Saying things like, “That sounds really tough,” or “I can see why you feel that way,” helps them feel validated. Avoid Immediate Fixes: Instead of jumping in with solutions, sometimes just being there and listening can be the most supportive response.",

Let them know their opinions and feelings are valued. Ask Open-Ended Questions: Instead of yes-or-no questions, try asking, “How did that make you feel?” or “What’s been on your mind lately?” This encourages deeper conversations.

And with good reason – acts of kindness impact the levels of certain neurotransmitters in our brains that affect happiness and attachment to others.Further, for those kids who seem to naturally struggle with kindness, the good news is that it can be taught just like any other skill.
